ifo Institute Twitter Bot

Introduction

This project is a proof of concept for a Twitter bot that automatically generates tweets based on press releases from the ifo Institute. The bot uses the GPT-3.5 API to generate tailored text for each tweet, and also includes an image related to the content of the press release.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have a GPT-3.5 API key. You can sign up for a GPT-3.5 API key from OpenAI.
Once you have your API keys, you will need to install the necessary Python packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt.
You will also need to create a key.txt file with your GPT key.

Usage

To use the ifo Institute Twitter bot, simply run the frontend.py script using streamlit:

bash
Copy code
python frontend.py
The bot will automatically generate tweets based on the latest press releases from the ifo Institute, and will enable you to post them to your Twitter account. You can customize them on the streamlit website.
